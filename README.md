## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
Soil & Weather-Based Advisory

Integration with soil testing data and local weather forecasts.

Provide crop recommendations suitable for specific soil type and current climatic conditions.

AI-Powered Crop & Input Suggestions

Use machine learning models to suggest suitable crops, optimal sowing time, and fertilizer use.

Pest and disease detection through image-based analysis using mobile apps.

Cost-Effective Resource Management

Optimize fertilizer, pesticide, and water usage to reduce costs and environmental harm.

Promote organic and sustainable practices.

Multi-Language Support & Voice Assistance

Support regional languages and voice-based interaction to overcome literacy barriers.

Simple mobile app and call-based services for easy farmer access.

Offline & Low-Cost Accessibility

Provide offline features with SMS/IVR support for areas with poor internet.

Affordable subscription or government-backed model for inclusivity.

Knowledge Sharing & Market Linkage

Connect farmers with experts and extension workers for direct advisory.

Provide information about nearby markets, demand, and fair pricing.

## Technical Approach
Data Collection & Integration

Soil Data: Integrated through soil testing kits or government soil health databases.

Weather Data: Real-time weather updates from APIs (e.g., IMD, OpenWeatherMap).

Crop Data: Historical crop yield, pest/disease patterns, and market trends.

Data Processing Layer

Preprocessing raw data (soil nutrients, rainfall, temperature, crop cycles).

Use ETL pipelines (Extract, Transform, Load) to clean and standardize data.

Machine Learning Models

Crop Recommendation Model: Suggests best-fit crops based on soil & weather.

Fertilizer & Pesticide Optimization: Predicts optimal input usage to reduce costs.

Pest/Disease Detection: Image recognition (using CNN models) for early pest detection from smartphone-captured images.

Advisory System

Rule-based + AI-driven engine to generate personalized recommendations.

Multi-language text and voice-based outputs for farmer-friendly interaction.

Application Layer (Frontend)

Mobile App (Android-first): Lightweight, intuitive design with icons & voice guidance.

SMS/IVR Service: For areas with low connectivity and low digital literacy.

Dashboard for Experts: Agricultural officers can monitor, validate, and update recommendations.

Backend Infrastructure

Cloud-based storage for scalability (AWS, Azure, or GCP).

REST APIs to connect data sources, ML models, and the mobile app.

Microservices architecture for modularity (crop advisory, weather updates, pest detection).

Security & Reliability

End-to-end encryption for farmer data privacy.

Offline caching to ensure the system works in low-connectivity regions.

Feedback & Continuous Learning

Farmers can provide feedback on crop yield & advisory effectiveness.

ML models continuously retrained to improve accuracy over time.

⚙️ Tech Stack Suggestion:

Frontend: Flutter/React Native (mobile app), HTML/CSS/JS (web).

Backend: Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI).

Database: PostgreSQL / Firebase.

ML Models: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch.

Cloud & APIs: AWS/GCP/Azure, OpenWeatherMap API.

## Feasibility and Viability
The proposed system is technically feasible as it leverages existing technologies like mobile apps, cloud platforms, weather APIs, and machine learning models that are already well-established. It is economically viable since development costs can be minimized through open-source tools, and scaling can be supported by government schemes or agri-tech partnerships. Socially, it is highly viable, as farmers gain access to localized, easy-to-use advisory services, improving yield, reducing input costs, and promoting sustainable farming practices.

## Impact and Benefits
The Smart Crop Advisory System will empower farmers with data-driven decisions, leading to higher crop yield, reduced input costs, and sustainable resource use. It bridges the gap of language and literacy barriers through multi-language and voice support, ensuring inclusivity. By promoting environment-friendly practices and reducing chemical overuse, it safeguards both soil health and the ecosystem. Overall, the solution enhances farmer income, food security, and rural economic growth.
